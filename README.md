## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note

The reward redemption functionality is currently simulated using static data. This means that:

* Rewards are not dynamically updated.
* Inventory management is not implemented.
* Actual reward fulfillment is not processed.

This is a demonstration of the system's flow, and the reward process will be further developed in future updates.
